Step 1: create visualizer
    - Helps with debugging
    - Easy way to get a grip of hex geometry & coordinates
Step 2: Load tile data in a useful format
    - Need to double-store information to answer two questions: "where is all the desert" and "what are the attributes of this tile"
Step 3: Stitching pieces together
    - Need to deal with rotation too
Step 4: Creating a player
    - Questions:
        Does the player hold a board instance? 
        Does the board hold player instances? (It certainly holds the information available to the players)
            => just has to hold which colors are in the game
        Does the player need to know where its own pieces on the board are (yes: it has to be able to give out non-duplicate information)
        How will the player identify itself? (Color)
        Strategy: asking another player vs investigating a hex (trading your own info for answers from all other players)
